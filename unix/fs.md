## tmp files
Sometimes you need a temporary file to store data in. There are several
approaches to this, though one of the best supported ways of achieving this is
using the `mktemp(1)` tool.

### mktemp
OS X / GNU `mktemp` are different, which is heaps confusing.
```sh
$ mktemp -d /tmp             # create directory
$ mktemp /tmp/"$$"-my-file   # create tmp file prefixed by pid
```

### /tmp
Not every distro adheres to the Linux
[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard),
but no need to sweat about it, we can create our own:
```sh
$ sudo mkdir /tmp
$ sudo chmod 1777 /tmp   # open to everyone + set sticky bit
```

## creating filesystems
__tools__
- `lsblk(1)` - list partitions on a device
- `mkfs(1)` - create a new filesystem from a device
- `mount(1)` - mount a filesystem on a node
- `unmount(1)` - unmount a filesystem on a node
- `mountpoint(1)` - see if a directory is a mountpoint
- `dd(1)` - convert and copy a file(system)
- `losetup(1)` - setup and control loop devices

## loop devices
[ tbi ]

## print file size in gigabytes of file
```sh
$ local_raw_size="$(stat --printf="%s" "$disk_file")"
$ dc -e "$local_raw_size 1024 / 1024 / 1024 / p"
```
