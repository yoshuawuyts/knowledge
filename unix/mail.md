# mail
Email is the emperor of asynchronous text-based communication. The formats are
well defined and tiny, and adoption is _very_ high.

## mailcap
Mailcap specifies which extensions to use to open files with. Out of the box
`mutt` performs horribly with anything but plain-text. Here's an example
`.mailcap` file:
```mailcap
text/plain; cat %s; copiousoutput
text/html; links -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput
application/pdf; /usr/bin/evince %s
text/pdf; /usr/bin/evince %s
image/*; feh %s
```

## Secure mail
Probably the best way of securing email is to host your own provider. After the
lavabit shutdown, it's probably a good option to use
[riseup](https://help.riseup.net/).
