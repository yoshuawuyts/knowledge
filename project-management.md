# project management

## 70 / 20 / 10 rule
- 70% of the time should be spend on things that happen now
- 20% of the time should be spent on things that are next
- 10% of the time should be spent on things spent on things for later

## 80 / 20
80% of the value comes from 20% of x. Find out what x is and cut down the rest.

## Sprint planning
Can use GH issues for this.
- sprint goals
  - human readable goal of the sprint
- sprint participants
  - @mentions
- sprint deliverables
  - per person
  - triage section (anyone can pick these up)

## Project request considerations
- What is the goal of the project?
- How will you and your client determine if the project is successful?
- What returns will you and your clients see as a result of the project?
- Who will participate from the client side?
- What range of services does the project require?
- What is your client’s budget for the project?
- Is there technology involved? If yes, what is the technology?
- Does your client employ anyone with expertise on the topic?
- What is the timeline for the project, and will your client require your
services after your work is complete?
