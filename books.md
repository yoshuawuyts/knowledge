Books I've read.

## The art of unix programming
- super neat introduction to _why_ unix programming matters
- often a bit dry
- without context sometimes difficult to plough through
- essential reading if you do anything with computers
- probably makes you a better human in the process

## Advanced programming in the Unix environment [in progress]
- describes a whole lot essential concepts in the unix system
- harder take on the _how_ of unix programming
