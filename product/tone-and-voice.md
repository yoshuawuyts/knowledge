# tone and voice
How you write something is more important than what you write. What good is
having all the knowledge in the world if it cannot be shared? Having a good
tone and voice is key to becoming likable. Companies like Slack do a
magnificent job at conveying _likability_.

## Frames
Tone and voice is an abstract concept; talking about it mostly hits the
superficial level, the _how_ of things. Framing is more integral to the message
in that it is the actual message itself. When you convey information, there's a
certain frame attached to it. What is the goal you're trying to achieve with
the information you're sending; what is the feeling you're trying to invoke?
Framing is staple to language, and recognizing the frame someone is using can
lead to a sharper understanding of someone's message.
