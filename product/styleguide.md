# style guide

Stuff about proper branding. Most stuff is from the exquisite Dropbox branding
site. They only use 4 colors and are super memorable! Link's below.

#### Logo
```
logotype         text + image    use whenever possible
glyph            image           use in UI with limited space
vertical lockup  text + image    use only in marketing with limited space
outline          image           use in UI with limited space
```
A small disclaimer below that from the dropbox site, note the tone of voice:
> Thanks for not editing, changing, distorting, recoloring, or reconfiguring the
> logo.

#### Logo colors
```
color        white background   most used
white        dark background    used on darker backgrounds
dark grey    white background   sparingly used
```
There dropbox goes again:
> Thanks for not embellishing on the logo with shadows, patterns, intricate
> backgrounds, or elaborate gold jewelry.

#### Brandname colors
Emphasis on who's colors it is. Explain what you're looking at:
> White canvases and cool grey copy splashed with accents of Dropbox blue.

Work should be of a color rectangle with:
- the color name
- if bg color give a border, else no border
- hex code of the color
- if used for print also include cmyk and pantone

#### Spacing considerations
- bunch 'o' text about the usage
- visual examples with the margins laid out
- technical, but damn important
- yes, this is part of a designers job

#### In writing
- Have a single correct writing
- Explain the gotchas in text
- Show examples of how it's not done

From the Dropbox website:
> Write Dropbox in plain text rather than embedding the logo into text

Solid.

#### Screenshots
- Explain what you're allowed to do legally (e.g. "feel free to use")
- Explain what you shouldn't do to screenshots
- Provide a bunch of quality screenshots in the press kit

#### Use of the materials
Here comes a whole slew of examples that probably cover your use case.
- In general
- Advertising, promotional, and sales materials
- Education and instruction (books, guides, publications, and conferences)
- Products, websites, names and logos
- Functional Uses (UIs / buttons)
- Linking to Dropbox
- Merchandise
- More questions? (and include screenshots so we can judge faster) (also don't
assume no answer = we agreed to whatever you're planning)
