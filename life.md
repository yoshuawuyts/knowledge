Owning stuff, doing stuff.

## morning ritual
Consistency is king. If you have kids you have to be the responsible one.
Thinking about this can keep you more sane. Even if you can't always make the
full ritual, it's good to have one. Best days are when you can make the full
length.

## Deal with being possessive
- tell your partner what's bothering you
- explain why it is that it bothers you, how it makes you feel
- don't try to change the other person
- find the underlying reasons for why things make you feel the way they do
(fears? previous experiences?)
