## Simplicity
- complexity is a constant
- complexity is objective
- simplicity is subjective
- complexity is how many operations need to be performed
  before achieving the goal.
- tesler's law of conservation of simplicity: Every application has an inherent
  amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal
  with it.

## Easing functions
### in / out
On the web `ease-in` is slower at the start. On the web `ease-out` is slower
at the end. `ease-in-out` combines both eases.

### acceleration
```
sine   1 Sine acceleration
quad   2 Quad acceleration
cubic  3 Cubic acceleration
quart  4 Quart acceleration
quint  5 Quint acceleration
expo   6 Exponential acceleration
```

## reasons to learn design
- bad design reflects poorly on your work
- clients will prefer pretty over bland, even if they're not designing
- being versatile will allow you to fill positions that demand versatility

## the krav maga of design
1. light comes from the sky
2. black and white first
3. double your whitespace
4. learn methods of overlaying text on images
5. make text pop -- and unpop
6. only use good fonts
7. steal like an artist

### light comes from the sky
Non obvious, very important. Elements higher on the screen should be lighter
than those lower on the screen.

### black and white first
It allows you to worry about less, initially. Analogous to 'mobile-first' it
constrains your decisions, allowing you to focus on the harder problem first.

### double your whitespace
Whitespace is the default. Taking away the whitespace is a conscious decision.
Be zen about it.

- put space between your lines
- put space between your elements
- put space between groups of elements

Analyze what works

### learn the methods of overlaying text on images
There are 5 + 1 methods of overlaying text on images:

#### apply text directly to images
Should generally not do this.

1. image should be dark
2. text has to be white
3. test it at every screen / size to make sure it's legible

#### overlay the whole image
Plop in a color and make the image darker. Shades of gray generally work well.

#### text-in-a-box
Whip up a mildly-transparent black rectangle and lather on some white text. If
the overlay is opaque enough, you can have just about any image underneath and
the text will still be totally legible.

#### blur the image
Blurring a part of the underlying image is relatively effective.
> You can also use the out-of-focus area of a photo as the blur. But beware—
> this method is not as dynamic. If your image ever changes, make sure the text
> is always over the blurry bits.

#### floor fade
Subtly fade to gray at the bottom part of the image. 500px is a great example
of this technique.

#### scrim
Gradient opacity box around text. Super subtle.

### Make text pop -- and unpop
> Styling text to look beautiful is often a matter of styling it in contrasting
> ways.

Ways to call for attention:
- Size (bigger or smaller)
- Color (greater contrast or lesser; bright colors draw the eye)
- Font weight (bolder or thinner)
- Capitalization (lowercase, UPPERCASE, and Title Case)
- Italicization
- Letter spacing (or— fancy term alert— _tracking_!)
- Margins (technically not a property of the text itself, but can be used to draw attention, so it makes the list)

### Up-pop and down-pop
Aka visual weight
- __up-pop__: styles that increase the visibility of the text
- __down-pop__: styles that decrease the visibility of the text

Page titles are the only element to style all-out __up-pop__.
For everything else, you need __up- _and_ down-pop__.

Also: styling text is hard. Try to balance things. If it doesn't look quite
right, keep trying until it does.

### Use good fonts
Some fonts are good. Use them.

## Mobile first
Allows you to tackle the hard problem first, what information matters, before
making it fit on a bazillion pixel screen.

## Fonts
- Entypo social - Social Media
- PT Sans - quite like lato
- Lato - clean, crisp
- Cabin - curvy
- Raleway - headlines only, distinct
- Montesserrat - two weights, like gotham / promixima nova
- Bebas Neue - titles, all caps
- Open Sans - easy to read, body
- Ubuntu - allrounder

## Steal like an artist
Unless you're inventing a new element see how others do it and cherry pick from
the best.
