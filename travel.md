## Booking a plane
- clear cache often, prices are set by cookies
- early vs last minute bookings? no idea which one is best
- most people often already have a cancellation insurance, don't get one twice
- be careful you don't tick extra options when travelling with a cheap company,
this is how they make money
- smaller airports often have better prices
- check if the flight no. you're planning to go on is available somewhere else,
sometimes the same flight is available for less somewhere else

## Planning a trip
- Investigate when you want to travel first, off-season can save 80% in costs
- Check out what you can do in the towns you're heading at. Make a day by day
plan.
- Never _just go somewhere_, planning on site is a waste of vacation time.

## Insurance
Travelling uninsured is super dangerous; if for some reason you end up in a
hospital (which could be for anything; even stuff that's out of your control)
there's a fair chance of you going bankrupt. Since I'm Dutch this part will
be focused on Dutchies that are moving abroad, though I'm sure that many
countries will have a rough equivalent of the terms described here.

If you're Dutch and stay >1 year abroad you're no longer insured for most
common things. Insurances provided by the Dutch state are:
- next of kin insurance (Anw)
- unfit for work insurance (AOW)
- insurance law (Zvw)
- long term care law (Wlz)
- social care law (Wmo)

Subscribing to the AOW and Anw can be done until 1 year after leaving the
country.

In addition there are other risks to take care of:
- liability insurance
- travel insurance

In Australia there are 3 types of insurances:
- life insurance
- health insurance
- general insurance (liability / property)

## Emigrating
Emigrating is a tricky beast. There's tons of things you need to take care of.
Here's a short list:
- information of embassee or consulate
- digital passport (DigID)
- taxes
- health insurance
- retirement fund
- legalisation of diploma's and documents
- welfare
