## morning ritual
Consistency is king. If you have kids you have to be the responsible one.
Thinking about this can keep you more sane. Even if you can't always make the
full ritual, it's good to have one. Best days are when you can make the full
length.

## Deal with being possessive
- tell your partner what's bothering you
- explain why it is that it bothers you, how it makes you feel
- don't try to change the other person
- find the underlying reasons for why things make you feel the way they do
  (fears? previous experiences?)

## Deal with being jealous
- talk about your fears, openly and immediately. Even if you think you're being
  irrational.
- jealousy is a symptome that someone is feeling insecure or threatened
- jealousy comes from someone's needs not being met or someone's being
  threatened
- people who don't feel threatened don't feel jealous
- jealousy is often rooted in other emotions such as fear of loss, feelings of
  rejection or insecurity (or anything else)
- once the feelings have been identified, ask yourself what these feelings are
  serving. Are they warning about a real problem or are you jealous for
  jealousy's sake?

## Purpose
> The things we can touch have no permanence. It is all an illusion. A person's
> primary need is to let go. Only then can they possess what is truly real.

## Todos
Email looks like a messaging system, but is actually a todo system that other
people can add to.
