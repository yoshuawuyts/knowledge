# writing
Writing is sharing information in an asynchronous format.

## publishers
- read an article
- find points to improve

## briefs
Publishers prefer to receive briefs rather than finished articles, this makes
it easier to guide direction before it's done.
- in one paragraph explain what you want to write about, who your intended
  audience is, and what they'll learn by the end of the article
- it's better not to send a finished article
