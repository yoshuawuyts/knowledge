# dom
While most developers have some understanding of how HTML and the DOM work,
there are a good amount of tags available that are most likely being misused. I
don't care about non-evergreen browsers, so that's the only guarantee about
compatibility I'm able to make.

## Tags
```txt
<nav>       the main navigation controls
<header>    the introductory block at the start of the page
<main>      the main content, should cover most of the page
<section>   the different parts of main
<footer>    page end, credits and stuff
<aside>     the sidebar, if any exists
```

## Events
A big gotcha of `dom` events it that they propagate to their parent nodes if left
unhandled. By setting `this.stopPropegation()` the events are no longer
propagated to their parents.

Another gotcha with the `dom`, is that when you're building dynamic systems
with JavaScript, existing dom nodes will have default behavior that is
executed. For example: when submitting a form, the default behavior is to
refresh the page after submission. To prevent this from happening you have to
use the `this.preventDefault()` method within the form element.

## Reflows & repaints
> A repaint occurs when changes are made to an elements skin that changes
> visibility, but do not affect its layout. Examples of this include outline,
> visibility, or background color. According to Opera, repaint is expensive
> because the browser must verify the visibility of all other nodes in the DOM
> tree.

> A reflow is even more critical to performance because it involves changes
> that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page).

## Buttons
Creating a button can be done in multiple ways (all depending on style).
Function comes down to semantics. Best practices for this are:
- __a__: use anchor tags for external links
- __button__: use buttons for all non-form related actions
- __input__: use input tags for all form related actions

## Push notifications on the web
Create a manifest in `index.html`:
```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
```

## Open links in new tab
```js
window.open(url, '_blank')
```

## window.fetch
Uses promises, first `.then` call defines in what form the data will be
displayed. The value can be one of `arrayBuffer()`, `blob()`, `formData()`,
`json()` and `text()`.
```js
window.fetch('http://localhost:1337')
  .then(function (res) { return res.text()})
  .then(function (res) {
    console.log(res)
  })
```

Setting cookie headers is not possible with `fetch`. Instead cookies can be set
through the `credentials` api. The value can be one of `omit`, `same-origin`,
`include` where `omit` is the default.
```js
fetch('/something', { credentials: 'same-origin' })
```

## media queries in JS
Using [window.matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
```js
if (window.matchMedia("(min-width: 400px)").matches) {
  /* the viewport is at least 400 pixels wide */
} else {
  /* the viewport is less than 400 pixels wide */
}
```

## set values in node
- `node.texContent` for text
