# work

- The key to productivity is to make your hours count.
- Don't FB at work, answer personal email, gossip or other stuff.
- Have a life besides work.
- Don't work after 6pm.
- You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.

## Time management
- Reserve easier chores for the end of the day.
- If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.
- Break your week open in segments, plan on a macro scale.
- Plan your day in segments, what are you going complete today?
- Have fixed moments for email / code review / other stuff. This gives you
headspace.

overhead in terms of time management.
