# work

- The key to productivity is to make your hours count.
- Don't FB at work, answer personal email, gossip or other stuff.
- Have a life besides work.
- Don't work after 6pm.
- You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.

## Time management
- Reserve easier chores for the end of the day.
- If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.
- Break your week open in segments, plan on a macro scale.
- Plan your day in segments, what are you going complete today?
- Have fixed moments for email / code review / other stuff. This gives you
headspace.

## Going freelance
- [switching to contracting UK](https://github.com/tadast/switching-to-contracting-uk/blob/master/README.md)

## Motivation
- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

## Taking interviews
Whenever you apply for a new job there's a bunch of questions you need to ask.

- what are the positions you have available
- what kind of employee are you looking for?
- tell them what you are looking for
- tell them when you're around / available to further chat

## Contracts
Signing contracts is important for yourself, and for your customers. Don't
hesitate to sign one at the start of a relationship. If you trust each other,
there shouldn't be a problem in persisting that trust.

A contract should contain the following:
- A simple overview of who is hiring who, what they’re being hired to do, when
  and for how much
- What both parties agree to do and what their respective responsibilities are
- The specifics of the deal and what is or isn’t included in the scope
- What happens when people change their minds (as they almost always do)
- A simple overview of liabilities and other legal matters
- You might even include a few jokes

## Starting a new job contracting job
- start working after the contract is signed
- take 24 hours to read through the contract and agree on terms
- some stuff might be non-negotiable, if you start working before it's signed
  there are no guarantees of pay
- terms might be unable to be agreed upon, and will then end up performing free
  work
