# Lentil Bolognese:

- Make sure you start early, cause the lentils need to soak for about 45mins
  first. So start soaking like a cup and a half of green lentils.  (i'm
  guessing the measurements cause I never measure)
- Chop one onion, a carrot, and like a thing of celery if you have it. Chuck it
  in a thing with some olive oil, a bay leaf and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.
- When the onion is like translucent, crush some garlic in there. Two cloves is
  good.
- Your lentils should be soft and kinda falling apart now, kinda mushy. Pour
  them and like 2 cups of the lentil water (if you drain them, reserve some
  water) into the pot.
- Add a cup of tomato passata, a chopped tomato, and two spoons of Massel
  veggie or chikn stock powder.

## Variations
-  Vegie sausage rolls + puff pastry (check it don't have butter) = vegie
   sausage rolls
