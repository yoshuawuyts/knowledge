## stream graphs
Stream graphs are to describe data over time. It's a form of a stacked graph,
where values are mapped out over time. It allows to see both totals and trends
over time.

### stream graphs with d3
In `d3` stream graphs can be created using [d3shape/stacks][0] and
[d3-scale/linear][1].
