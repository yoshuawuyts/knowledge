# auth
Authentication, credentials and such.

- __Authentication__ - is the process of verification that an individual,
  entity or website is who it claims to be. Authentication in the context of
  web applications is commonly performed by submitting a user name or ID and
  one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.
  [(source)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet)

- __Session Management__ - is a process by which a server maintains the state
  of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember
  how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are
  maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and
  forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving
  requests.  Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very
  difficult to predict.

## Cookies
### cookie attributes
- __Secure:__ only send cookie on HTTPS connection. Prevents man in the middle
  attacks.
- __HttpOnly:__ don't allow access to cookies through JS / DOM.
- __Domain:__ send cookie to specified domain + subdomain instead of origin
  server.
- __Path:__ only send cookie to specified directory or subdirectory (path /
  resource) within the web app.
- __Max-Age:__ preferable over `Expires`. Makes cookies persist, and not
  disappear when browser window is closed.
- __Expires:__ expire a cookie on a date.

## OAuth
Oauth does 2 things:
- allow a resource to talk to other resources (e.g. inter-app communication)
- allow a 3rd party client to talk to a resource (e.g. custom clients)

Architecturally there are 2 parts: the authorization server which issues
tokens, and the API which requires tokens.

### authorization grant
4 types of authorizations can be granted:
- __Authorization Code:__ apps running on a web server
- __Implicit:__ browser-based or mobile apps
- __Password:__ login with username and password
- __Client Credentials:__ application access

#### Authorization code
1. Create "login" link:
```txt
https://oauth2server.com/auth?response_type=code&
  client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=photos
```

2. user sees authorization prompt
3. "allow" -> redirect back to site with auth code
```txt
https://oauth2client.com/cb?code=AUTH_CODE_HERE
```

4. your server exchanges auth code for access token
```txt
POST https://api.oauth2server.com/token?
  grant_type=authorization_code&
  code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&
  redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
  client_id=CLIENT_ID&
  client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
```

5. server replies with access token or error
```json
{
  "access_token":"RsT5OjbzRn430zqMLgV3Ia"
}
```
```json
{
  "error":"invalid_request"
}
```

#### Browser-Based apps

### performing a request
Either with a query string or with a header. Header is preferable, qs is useful
for quick browser testing.
```sh
$ curl https://api.github.com/user?access_token=OAUTH-TOKEN
```
```sh
$ curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

### redirect uri
`redirect_uri` is optional, as applications should have a default
`redirect_uri`. When specified, port, protocol and route should match up
perfectly, only sub paths are allowed.

### oauth scopes
Scopes limit what actions can be performed by a token. It's good practice to
log them out in the response headers.
```
curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie -I
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-OAuth-Scopes: repo, user
X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user
```
- `X-OAuth-Scopes` - list scopes your token has authorized.
- `X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes` - list scopes action checks for.

A good pattern of defining scopes is by  `<domain>` / `<domain>:<sublevel>`.

## Single Sign On (SSO)
SSO is an authentication / authorization flow through which a user can log into
multiple services using the same credentials.
[source](https://stormpath.com/blog/oauth-is-not-sso/)

This is done through `3-legged auth`, which means there's a server to request
credentials from, a client that consumes them and a user that authorizes the
transaction.
```txt
req client -> authorization grant -> req server
req server -- authorization grant -> resource owner
req server <- authorization grant -- resource owner
req server -- authorization grant -> authorization server
req server <- access token --------- authorization server
req client <- access token --------- req server
req client -- access token --------> resource server
req client <- protected resource --- resource server
```
### tokens
- __access token:__
- __refresh token:__

### internal services
When using internal OAuth for internal services, it's easier to use a
whitelist than ask the user for approval. Though generally this shouldn't be
needed.

### single sign out
The other SSO is single sign out. When a user signs out of a service on a
domain, they should be signed out of all services on the domain. This can be
somewhat hard to achieve when applications.

## JSON Web Token (JWT)
Self-container, safe.

Every JWT contains 3 parts:
- first 36 bits are info
- bits in the middle are the JSON payload
- last 43 bits are the signature hash

The payload should have the following values:
- __iss:__ who issued the token (issuer)
- __exp:__ token expiry
- __scope:__ which resources can be accessed
- __sub:__ subject to who the token was issued

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Because cookies are included on every call to a domain, regardless from which
domain that call occurs, it can be abused to do bad things.

### synchronizer token design pattern
To prevent bad things, the classic approach is to use CSRF tokens. A CSRF token
can be the same as the session, and should generally be stored in the session
storage. The token is then sent as a header on every request, and can be
verified on the server.

Note: client based approaches will break down once XSS can be exploited; fix
XSS bugs!

### lock down JSON based REST API
- Single Origin policy (only allow cross site HEAD / GET & POST)
- lock down mime types (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
  `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`)
- GET should never trigger side effects
- disallow any non-JSON POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
- `multipart/form-data` needs to still be handled

### check HTTP referrer header
- check `referee` header for `multipart/form-data` POST and friends
- `referrer` is set by a browser and tells which page (url) triggered a request
- disallow requests without `referrer` present

### client side CSRF token
Create a cookie + HTTP header on every request, server verifies they are the
same which means they're from the right domain. This works because a website
can only read / write cookies for their own domain, and only the real site can
also set their headers.

### sync token++
Every response returns a new token. Tokens are added to a pool. If the chain of
tokens used is broken, validation CSRF happened and thus a request is thrown
out. A dedicated attacker might implement the token pool handling logic, but
that would add a great amount of complexity. Further matching of tokens +
headers could further obfuscate this.

In the case of `http2` a single request token in the pool is sufficient, making
the implementation more secure because there is no pool of tokens to read from.
State is then managed internally, which means that if the token was used for
some reason CSRF happened and appropriate measures can be taken.
