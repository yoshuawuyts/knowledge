# domains
Domains are the area of application your application works within.

## models
- interpretation of the domain
- models are always wrong
- but some are useful
- we don't model reality, we model useful abstractions

## Ubiquitous language
- a language structured around the domain model
- used by the team members and throughout the code

## Bounded context
- and explicit boundary within which a domain model exists
- inside all terms have a specific meaning
- they are part of ubiquitous language
- high cohesion (things that work together stick together)
- loose coupling (things rely as little as possible on each other)
- Represents business capability
- context-specific model

> we don't want to build a model that works for everyone

> We don't design a one-size-fits-all architecture, because it doesn't fix
> anything well.

## Micro services
- individual persistence
- individual tech stacks
- individual deployability
- individual replacability
- individual scalability
- can fail individually

## What are microservices about?
- free choice of architecture
- free choice of persistence
- free choice of language
